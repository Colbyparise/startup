### Elevator pitch

Asaka Photos is a destination wedding and editorial photography brand capturing authentic, documentary-style moments in both film and digital. This project creates a custom website that eliminates reliance on third-party booking platforms (like Pixieset, which takes a 5% cut). By managing our own booking, payments, and gallery delivery, we save costs, streamline the client experience, and give couples a beautiful, seamless way to book and relive their special day.

### Design
The website will list package deals, have options for payments, give quotes, and allow a user to login in and book a photoshoot.

- **CSS** – Clean, elegant styling that matches the Asaka Photos brand (minimal, modern aesthetic).

- **React** – Dynamic components for portfolio navigation, calendar availability, and gallery viewing.
