# ASAKA PHOTOS

[My Notes](notes.md)

A full-featured photography website for Asaka Photos (Destination Wedding & Editorial Photography).
Specialty: Destination wedding and editorial photography
Based: Utah, available worldwide
Style: Documentary-style moments captured on film + digital


## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator pitch

Asaka Photos is a destination wedding and editorial photography brand capturing authentic, documentary-style moments in both film and digital. This project creates a custom website that eliminates reliance on third-party booking platforms (like Pixieset, which takes a 5% cut). By managing our own booking, payments, and gallery delivery, we save costs, streamline the client experience, and give couples a beautiful, seamless way to book and relive their special day.

### Design
The website will list package deals, have options for payments, give quotes, and allow a user to login in and book a photoshoot.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** â€“ Structure for portfolio, booking pages, and client galleries.

- **CSS** â€“ Clean, elegant styling that matches the Asaka Photos brand (minimal, modern aesthetic).

- **React** â€“ Dynamic components for portfolio navigation, calendar availability, and gallery viewing.

- **Service** (Node/Express) â€“ Backend service to handle bookings, payments, and gallery delivery.

- **DB/Login** (PostgreSQL + JWT Auth) â€“ Secure login for clients, store bookings, user data, and delivered gallery links.

- **WebSocket** â€“ Real-time booking updates (e.g., calendar instantly updates when a date is reserved).
